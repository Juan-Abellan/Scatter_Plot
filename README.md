# Scatter_Plot

## Background & Objectives

In this exercise, we are going to recreate plots from this [article](https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/ThreeNum.html).

To learn more best practices around bubble plots, read these 3 short articles.

- [Radius or Area](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/radius_or_area.html)
- [Area readability](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/area_hard.html)
- [Overplotting](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/overplotting.html)

## Data

We will work with the GDP per capita dataset.

## Tools

For this challenge, we will work with Jupyter Notebook and some Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and Seaborn. At the end we will play around with  plotly in order to develop an interactive plot.
